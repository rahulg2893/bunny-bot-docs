    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 26, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>
      By inviting Bunny Bot (“the Bot”) to your Discord server or otherwise
      interacting with it, you agree to these Terms of Service and our Privacy
      Policy. If you do not agree, you may not use the Bot.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>
      You must be at least 13 years old, or the minimum age required in your
      country, to use Discord and therefore to use Bunny Bot. By using the Bot,
      you confirm that you meet this requirement.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Use of the Bot</h2>
    <p>You agree to use Bunny Bot in compliance with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Discord’s
        <a href="https://discord.com/terms" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a>
        and
        <a href="https://discord.com/guidelines" target="_blank"
          >Community Guidelines</a
        >
      </li>
      <li>All applicable local, national, and international laws</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You may not use the Bot for malicious activity, spam, harassment,
      exploitation, or any unlawful purpose.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Service Availability</h2>
    <p>
      Bunny Bot is provided “as is” and “as available.” We do not guarantee
      uninterrupted uptime, error-free operation, or compatibility with all
      servers. Features may change, be removed, or added at any time without
      prior notice.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Usage</h2>
    <p>
      Our data collection practices are described in our
      <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. By using the Bot, you agree to
      the handling of your data as outlined there.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      To the fullest extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any damages,
      losses, or issues arising from your use or inability to use the Bot,
      including but not limited to data loss, server issues, or moderation
      decisions.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Termination</h2>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to restrict or terminate your access to Bunny Bot at
      any time, for any reason, including but not limited to violation of these
      Terms or Discord’s policies.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms may be updated from time to time. Material changes will be
      announced via the support server. Continued use of the Bot after changes
      are posted constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Contact</h2>
